###Building a RESTful Web Service

This guide walks you through the process of creating a "hello world" RESTful web service with Spring.

[spring-guides-rest](http://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/)

###What you'll build
Youâ€™ll build a service that will accept HTTP GET requests at:

```
http://localhost:8080/greeting
```

and respond with a JSON representation of a greeting:

```
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
```

You can customize the greeting with an optional name parameter in the query string:

```
http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User
```

The name parameter value overrides the default value of "World" and is reflected in the response:

```
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, User!"}
```
